      <p class="quote">“If you have an apple and I have an apple, and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have
      one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea, and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.</p>

      <p class="quoter"><strong>The translation </strong></p>
      I know that translating is an art. The professor Brenno Silveira talks in his book <em>The art of translation </em>that translating
      is all, except sample. I have seen that it’s really, - all is able, but not sample! This work has two segments, both with
      expression and content plans that must be well defined.<br/><br/>In the first segment, the translator need to be loyal to
      the document and to the author. He need respects the authorship as so to find in the new language the linguisstic elements,
      as near as possible, to translate the ideas of the author.<br/><br/>About Web texts sometimes is necessary to get a few knowlodges
      about the article whose you are working, for example, testing installation, trying options, or to see how it works. Is important
      to have a link between the autor with translator, or about technical text is important the translator understanding the subject
      that will be translate.]]>
